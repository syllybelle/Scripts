# Viedoc Multi-Study Export – How to Run

Designed to be as run-anywhere as possible

## What this does

- Reads a CSV of studies and API credentials, rather than relying on command line arguments.
- Starts a data export per study, polls the export until Ready, downloads the file, and saves it to a structured folder.
- Provides fine-grained control of export folder structure
- Allows fallbacks to default configurations when several studies have the same configuration.
- allows study-level specification of acceptable wait times and retry intervals.
- (Optional) Unzips CSV exports after saving.
- Logs progress and errors to a file.

## Prerequisits

### R packages

```R
install.packages(c("logging","readr","fs","base64enc","stringr"))
```

## Configuration

### Files & paths

export_file_location: existing or creatable folder where outputs + logs go.
study_api_client_csv: path to your input CSV (see schema below).
Windows tip: keep the path short and writable, e.g. `C:/Users/<you>/Exports.`

### Main toggles (top of the script)

- export_file_location – root folder for outputs and log.txt.
- study_api_client_csv – CSV with study rows.
- nest_by – how to structure subfolders (refered to as "level 1" and "level 2"):
  - "STUDY" → `…/<study_ref>/<ingest_time>/...` (level_1: study_ref, level_2: ingest_time)
  - "INGEST" → `…/<ingest_time>/<study_ref>/...` (level_1: ingest_time, level_2: study_ref)
- nest_depth – how many subfolders:
  - `0` → no subfolders; generated filename includes both level_1 and level_2
  - `1` → one level (level_1), generated filename contains level_2
  - `2` → two levels (level_1/level_2)
  - `3` → three levels (level_1/level_2/<study_ref>)
- exclude_download_name – if TRUE, don’t append the server’s filename to the saved name ({study ID}__{UTC time}).
- exclude_generated_name – if TRUE, don’t prepend the generated prefix (study/local time) to the saved name.
- unzip_CSVs – if TRUE and the requested outputFormat is CSV, unzip the saved .zip next to it.
- break_on_fail – if TRUE, stop the whole run on first failing study; otherwise continue. Useful for intitial test runs

### Global defaults (top of the script)

The defaults list provides per-row fallback values if the CSV doesn’t include them:

```R
defaults <- list(
  apiURL = "https://v4apistage.viedoc.net",
  tokenURL = "https://v4stsstage.viedoc.net/connect/token",
  maximum_wait_time_in_s = 300,
  check_every_n_s = 10,
  export_model = list(
    outputFormat = "CSV"   # "CSV" | "Excel" | "XML" | "PDF"
    # (optional) add other API export options here
  )
)
```

If a column with the same name exists in the CSV and has a value for a row, it **overrides** the default for that row.

### Study list schema

- Minimum required columns:
  - study_ref – identifier used in folder/filename (does not need to match the Viedoc GUID)
  - clientId – OAuth client id for the study.
  - clientSecret – OAuth client secret for the study.
- Optional columns (override defaults if present):
  - apiURL
  - tokenURL
  - maximum_wait_time_in_s
  - check_every_n_s
  - export_model

Example studies.csv

```plaintext
study_ref,clientId,clientSecret,apiURL,tokenURL,maximum_wait_time_in_s,check_every_n_s
STUDY_A,aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee,SECRET_A,https://v4apitraining.viedoc.net,https://v4stsstage.viedoc.net/connect/token,300,10
STUDY_B,ffffffff-1111-2222-3333-444444444444,SECRET_B,,,600,15
```

> For STUDY_B, blank apiURL/tokenURL fall back to the global defaults.

### Defining the study model

The [API export model](https://v4api.viedoc.net/swagger/index.html) is a json representation of the UI Export Tool in Viedoc Clinic.

- Commented out = optional override of default value.
  - You can “uncomment” the branch you want to enable.
- indentation shows dependencies
  - If parent is not set, the child value is ignored/invalid.
  - timePeriodOption only valid if timePeriodDateType is set.
- Option blocks `~~ if x ~~`
  - Child options are dependant on the parent value.
  - e.g. if timePeriodDateType is specified/not None, the dates that can be specified will depend on the timePeriodOption.
- Additional dependencies/constraints specified in comments (e.g. only available for certain formats)

> Defining the study model in the CSV can allow for imports at the site level.

## What gets created (output structure)

Given:
`nest_by = "STUDY"`
`nest_depth = 3`
`exclude_download_name = TRUE`
`exclude_generated_name = FALSE`
`outputFormat = "CSV"`

You will get a path like:
`<export_file_location>/<study_ref>/<ingest_time>/<study_ref>/<study_ref>.zip`
…and, if unzip_CSVs = TRUE, the .zip is unzipped next to it.

If both generated and download names are excluded, the script falls back to using <study_ref> as the basename.

## Logging

A study-specific handler is not configured, but everything is written to:

`<export_file_location>/log.txt`

Each study also logs progress in the same file. (You can easily add per-study log files if desired.)

## Error handling & control flow

- Token retrieval: if OAuth fails, the study is marked failed.
- Start export: if the API returns an error or no exportId, the study is failed.
- Polling: polls every check_every_n_s seconds up to maximum_wait_time_in_s. If never Ready, the study is failed.
- Download: binary download (no JSON parsing). If empty, the study is failed.
- Write file: wrapped in tryCatch; on failure, the study is failed.

- After each study:
  - If the returned path is NULL, the study failed. With break_on_fail = TRUE the loop stops; otherwise it moves on to the next study.
  - If unzip_CSVs = TRUE and outputFormat == "CSV", the script unzips the saved archive.

## Security considerations

- Never log clientSecret. The script avoids printing secrets.
- Store studies.csv in a secure location with restricted permissions.
- Avoid committing credentials to version control.
- Whitelist IP addresses and limit the API client scope while setting up the API client.

## Troubleshooting

- Permission denied (package install): on Windows, restart R, delete 00LOCK in your library, or install to a user library:

```R
dir.create("~/Rlibs", showWarnings = FALSE)
.libPaths(c("~/Rlibs", .libPaths()))
install.packages("base64enc", lib="~/Rlibs")
```

- Nothing written: check log.txt for HTTP errors:
  - `401`/`403` — bad credentials/invalid client
    - the configuration specified in the CSV does not match the API client setup in Viedoc Admin, or the IP address has note been whitelisted
  - `404` — wrong URL : ensure you are using the correct Viedoc API for the study server (training/production)
  - `5xx` — server issues.

- CSV paths on Windows: use forward slashes or double backslashes:
`C:/path/to/studies.csv` or `C:\\path\\to\\studies.csv`.

## One-glance run steps

- Fill out studies.csv with study_ref, clientId, clientSecret (+ optional overrides).
- Set export_file_location, nest_by, nest_depth, and flags (unzip_CSVs, break_on_fail, etc.).
- Run the script.
- Check log.txt for progress and errors.
- Find your exports under the folder structure defined by nest_by and nest_depth.
